# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and an M.S. student in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am an active member of the [Center for the Economics of Sustainability](https://ceos.illinois.edu/index.php/node/525) and the [Big Data for Enviromental Economics and Policy](https://peter-christensen-pe55.squarespace.com/). My work focuses on supply chain, transportation, agricultural/food economics, as well as environmental economics. I use causal inference techniques, applied machine learning, computational data science, digital field experiments, and empirical industrial organization in my research. 

My main research path goes in two directions:

### 1. Ground Freight Transportation and Agricultural Supply Chains
I examine how ground transportation competition operates in middle-income countries and analyze their responses to increasing costs in terms of market power, coping mechanisms, and strategic behavior. I also study how disruptions in trucking transportation networks, such as landslides, affect food-price integration across markets and explore what policymakers can do to mitigate these effects.

### 2. Ride-Hailing Services
I investigate how private ride-hailing companies can enhance mobility in developing countries and promote greater use of rail systems in the United States. I am part of a collaborative team that works on projects between Uber and the University of Illinois, employing digital experiments to evaluate ride-to-connect policies.

# Professional Experience

Beyond academia, I have over 4 years of experience across sectors such as transportation, food and agriculture, consulting, and marketing. I have gained extensive industry experience as a Senior Financial and strategy analyst in various multinational companies, where I optimized operational costs and improved financial performance. I also worked as a consultant, where I developed machine learning tools for price forecasting and supply chain analysis. 

I also do some freelance work sometimes. If you’re interested in exploring some of the projects I’ve been involved in, feel free to [take a look here](https://gustavo1803.github.io/portfolio/)
