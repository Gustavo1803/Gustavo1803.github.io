# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and an M.S. student in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on transportation economics, environmental economics, and food markets. I am fascinated by the implicit mechanisms that drive decision-making among market actors, and my work centers on three main areas:

### 1. Prices and Disruptions
I study how climate change-related disruptions, such as landslides, affect food price integration across markets and explore what policymakers can do to mitigate these effects.  

### 2. Ground Freight Transportation Market Power
I examine how ground transportation competition operates in middle-income countries and analyze their responses to increasing disruptions in terms of market power, coping mechanisms, and strategic behavior.  

### 3. Ride-Hailing and Public Transit
I investigate how private companies offering ride-hailing services can help increase the use of rail systems in the United States.  

To study these topics, I employ causal inference techniques, applied machine learning, computational data science, digital field experiments, and empirical industrial organization. My findings aim to harmonize and improve the relationship between private companies and public policy, with an environmental focus.  

# Professional Experience

Beyond academia, I bring over 10 years of experience across sectors such as transportation, food and agriculture, consulting, and marketing. This diverse background has given me a deep understanding of complex systems and data-driven decision-making.

My strong foundation in consulting, as well as financial and strategic roles, enables me to merge business expertise with applied scientific skills. I leverage advanced data science techniques to evaluate investment opportunities in various sectors across middle-income countries, including real estate, tourism, and agriculture.
