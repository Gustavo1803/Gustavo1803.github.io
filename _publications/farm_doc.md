This article focuses on US markets for Hass avocados, the dominant avocado variety in the US, representing 95% of total consumption. Hass avocados have over time become the preferred variety for producers and consumers because of their comparatively high yields, uniform size, and consistency. Their tough skin allows them to better survive the shipping process . Even though the Hass avocado market has grown substantially over time and is expected to grow more in the future, US avocado consumption decreased in the last year. Sales declined 12.6% nationally. In some states such as Texas and Louisiana, consumption was 23.4% lower in 2021 compared to the year prior.
