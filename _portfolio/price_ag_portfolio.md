We conducted a predictive analysis using a variety of models, including Lasso and Ridge regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Facebook Prophet, and advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This analysis provided comprehensive insights to determine the optimal times for sowing and harvesting, as well as to evaluate potential arbitrage opportunities through product storage.
