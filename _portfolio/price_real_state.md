We scraped data from the leading real estate website in Colombia and conducted a hedonic price analysis to identify the features that influence real estate prices in three major cities. The primary objective of the project was to train multiple models to help the company determine whether an asset was undervalued for purchase and to optimize its features to achieve a higher price in the future.
